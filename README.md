This project allows users to add movies to the website for others to download. The movies have specs, that give specifications about each of the movies like movie length, who were the actors, genre, and also the plot of the movie. Each movie also has reviews. When a new movie is created, you can also add reviews for it for other users to see. If one of the users does not like the movie, then there is also an option to delete the movie from the database. At the end when the user wants to download the movie, then all they have to do is click the download movie link to have it started. I would say, writing code in ruby was not the hard part. The hard part was making both the front end and the backend of the code to link. I started this whole project from the backend. I created my migrations and made tables for both the movies and the reviews. I made sure each table would have unique properties that I would want to display at the end of the project. I then created the two models for the movies and reviews. I then added controllers with the CRUD functionality that would help me link the backend to the frontend into JSON format.
